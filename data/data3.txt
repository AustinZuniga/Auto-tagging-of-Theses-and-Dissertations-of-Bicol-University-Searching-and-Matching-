LOGIC BATTLE," (Unpublished Undergraduate Thesis, Bicol University
College of Science, Legazpi City, March 2013)

Logic Battle focused on the design and development of a modified tic-tac-
toe game. The modified game which incorporates the idea of logic gates is a
miliarity to individuals with computer-related courses. Specifically the objectives
are identified and formulated to serve as a guide in the development of the
proposed project: to formulate a modified game mechanics of Tic-Tac-Toe
together with the concept of logic gates, to develop an interactive graphical
interface for the modified Tic-Tac-Toe with animation and sounds, to establish a
turn-based and synchronous two player game in two approaches, Stand-alone
game and via (LAN) Local Area Network and lastly to include a replay of moves
The researchers used Chris Crawford's Game Development sequence as
guidance in building the system. The researchers used UNITY 4.0 (Free Full
Version for Windows with Unity Pro and Android trials), as its primary tool in
developing the game and used Unity script as its programming language. Aside
the game editor itself, MonoDevelop, a script editor included with Unity, was
utilized.
The objectives, from which the researchers based this thesis, were all
accomplished and met. Moreover, the developed system was tested and has
received positive feedbacks. It is recommended to enhance the game to other
platforms such as iOS, XBox, PS3, Wii, Web Player, Flash, etc.
