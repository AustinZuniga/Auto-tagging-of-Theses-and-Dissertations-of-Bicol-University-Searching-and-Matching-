The LP Solver (Linear Programming Solver) was developed to help users, who
have basic knowledge in Linear Programming in solving for the optimal solution for a
given LP Model. This software provides two applications; the automatic mode that will
automatically compute for the optimal solution and the tutorial mode which is an
interactive way of computing for the solution of LP model.
The study focused on the three methods in solving for the optimal solution; the
Simplex Method, M-Method and the Two Phase Method. The researchers have
developed their own algorithms in implementing the three methods based on how these
methods are implemented manually. The software accepts a LP Model with n variables
and m constraints; where n is greater than one but not greater than ten, and m is greater
than zero but not greater than ten. Accepted coefficients of a LP Model for this software
are in rational form or decimal form with two decimal places. Generated solutions are
rational numbers specifically in fraction form for accuracy. Moreover, the application
includes sample LP models and covers cases such as Degeneracy, Alternative Optima,
Unbounded and Infeasible Solution. The software does not produce a graphical display of
the solution. Overall, the software gives an alternative way in solving and understanding
the process of solving LP models.
