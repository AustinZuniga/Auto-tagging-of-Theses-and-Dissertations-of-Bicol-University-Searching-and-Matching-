The develop LAN Based TumbangPreso can be played through a
computer network and supports wireless LAN connectivity. It integrates
animations and sounds as well as graphics to enhance playability and also
promote traditional Filipino games.
The study covers all the real rules of a traditional tumbangpreso game. It
is usually played by three or more players. For player versus computer, an
Artificial Intelligence will be available to challenge any human player.
The researchers used the developmental and descriptive type of research,
Chris Crawford Game Development was utilized as their software development
process.
The sources of data were gathered through various sources including
books, journals, reports, undergraduate thesis, published and unpublished
materials from several libraries and the Internet. As for the programming
language the researchers used ActionScript for developing the game.
The developed system was tested and received positive feedbacks such
as its reliability, playability and user friendly interface. The system will
significantly aid in pursuing other researchers in game development. It is
recommended that it should be implemented to promote traditional game.
